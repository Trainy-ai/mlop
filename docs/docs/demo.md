**MLOP** (bottom left) is a lot more responsive than conventional alternative experimental tracking tooling (bottom right). 
  
**MLOP**'s lightweight and asynchronous design allows it to perform the same tasks significantly faster. Additionally, the performance does not critically suffer in a high throughput scenario either - this is, however, a common problem with other tools in this category. Supporting high data ingestion rates should be a priority to achieve efficient MLOps. It is the future trend as compute gets better.
